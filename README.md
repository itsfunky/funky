# Funky

Funky lets you develop and build lambdas/functions for multiple cloud services, while allowing you to test and iterate quickly when developing locally.

## Example

```go
package main

import (
  "io"
  "net/http"
  
  "github.com/itsfunky/funky"
)

func main() {
  funky.Handle(http.HandlerFunc(func (w http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request) {
    io.WriteString(w, "Hello World")
  }))
}
```
